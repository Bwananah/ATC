Before running the program, check that `using_jetson` in `parameters.py` is set to:
-  `True` if running on the Jetson nano
-  `False` if running on your computer

To run the computer vision program, run the `main.py` file in `vision`.

To try out different parameters, just change the values in `parameters.py`.
